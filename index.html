     <header> <h2>Python Syntax Basics</h2> </header>
          <p>Python's syntax is straightforward and easy to learn. Here are a few basic examples:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Variables and data types:</li>

              <code>
            # Variable assignment
x = 10           # Integer
y = 3.14         # Float
name = "Python"  # String
is_active = True # Boolean</code>

              <li>control flow</li>

              <code> 
            # Conditional statements
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")

# Loops
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

while x > 0:
    print(x)
    x -= 1</code>

             <li>functions</li>

             <code>
               # Function definition
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Calling a function
print(greet("World"))</code>

            </ul>
